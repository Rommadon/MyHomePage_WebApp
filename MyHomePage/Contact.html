            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;width: 800px;padding-left: 50px;font-size:35px;">Client-Server Network Design and the Webs</h2>
            <p style="padding-left: 50px; font-size:20px;">In computer networking, client-server is a standard method for designing applications where data is kept in central
                locations (server computers) and efficiently shared with any number of other computers (the clients) on request.
                All web browsers function as clients that request information from websites (servers). Numerous web browser
                clients can request data from the same website. Requests can happen at all different times or simultaneously.
                Client-server systems conceptually call for all requests to the same site to be handled by one server. In
                practice, however, because the volume of requests to web servers can sometimes grow very large, web servers
                are often built as a distributed pool of multiple server computers. For very large websites popular in different
                countries around the world, this web server pool is geographically distributed to help improve the response
                time to browsers. If the server is closer to the requesting device, it would follow that the time it takes
                to deliver the content is faster than if the server were further away.</p>
